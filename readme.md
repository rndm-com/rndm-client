# RNDM Client

## About

Assistant Util for [RNDM Render](https://github.com/rndm-com/rndm-render). This client packages [RNDM Render](https://github.com/rndm-com/rndm-render) along side the [Core Preset](https://github.com/rndm-com/rndm-render-preset-core).

### Why RNDM?

The core concept is to be able to pass in static JSON or JavaScript objects, which will be rendered out as JavaScript and presented as Platform Native views.

This type of flexibility allows for less code and more statically defined pages, methods and more. In an asingle change of an API you can deliver entirely new user paths and even entire applications all through a server driven JSON structure. This becomes especially prevalent when considering applications built on Native Platforms using React Native as this can mean a completely API driven deployment.
